# Maas Database

Click [here](https://maas-api.herokuapp.com/characters) to visit the website
<br><br>
This project is aimed at creating an API which allows users to add their favorite Sarah J. Maas's book characters to the Database. It's very hard to keep track of all her characters that she includes in her book series. While there are other websites out there that do this, I wanted to try and create an API that would allow users to do the same while also being able to use this in their own projects.

## How to get started
> This will all be done through using ```Postman``` and once done check <b>GET</b> routes with this [link](https://maas-api.herokuapp.com/users) or through Postman
<br>
1. Create 2 users using <b>POST ```/users```</b> :

```
{
    "username": "{ENTER YOUR USERNAME HERE}",
    "password": "{ENTER YOUR PASSWORD HERE}"
}
```

```
{
    "username": "testUser",
    "password": "testPassword"
}
```

 * Go to <b>GET ```/users```</b> to make sure users are created

> Copy your username's user.Id from and save somewhere

<br>

2. Create a character using <b>POST ```/characters``` :</b>

```
{
    "book": "Throne of Glass",
    "name": "Dorian",
    "age": "21",
    "species": "Human",
    "powers": "Raw Power",
    "summary": "Aelin's friend and King of Adarlan",
    "author": "{Copy-Paste your username's saved User.Id}",
}
```

 * Go to <b>GET ```/characters```</b> to make sure character is created

<br>

3. Change the the username of ```user2``` using <b>PUT ```/users/{user2.ID}```</b>

```
{
    "username": "maasfan"
}
```

 * Go to <b>GET ```/users/{maasfan.ID}```</b> to make sure username is updated

<br>

4. Let's Delete ```testUser``` since we are not using it using <b>DELETE ```/users/{testUser.ID}```</b>
 * Go to <b>GET ```/users```</b> to make sure it's deleted

<br>
You can now experiment by creating, reading, updating, and deleting other users and characters too!
